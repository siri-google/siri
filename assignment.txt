assignment 1 : write a program to implement basic concept of java programming

Assignment 2: 
create table emp(
eno int primary key,                     (underlined = primary key)
ename
bdata,
title,
salary,
dno
);

create table proj(
pno,
pname,
budget,
dno
);

create table workson(
eno, pno,
resp,
hours
);

there are tow wildcard symbol - % and _
% use for 0 or more character
_ used for single character 

display names of employee whose name start with 'a'
'A%"
select eno,name,salary from emp where ename like 'A%';

select eno,name,salary from emp where ename like '%A';           //if we want A at last

for list of values we use the 'IN' operator : IN [10,20,30]

to limit : 'civ__' :- it will only allow only two character in front of that (n underscore = n character)

select the string in which department name should be exactly of 8 character
select * from dept where dname like '________';

> how to use the both symbol
	->display all records of employee where whose salary starts with 8 in the first position and has any two character and has 3 in the 3rd position
	select * from emp where salary like '8__3%';

last five question query's for wildcard character
write an sql qery that returns employee number name title and salary of those employee whose name start with letter 'A'
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ end with letter 'A'
display all records of department where department name begins with 'civ' followed by 2 character
display all records of department where department name should contain 8 character only 
display all the records of employee's whose salary starts with 8 in the first position has any two character in 2nd and 3rd position and then has 3 in the 4mrth position
